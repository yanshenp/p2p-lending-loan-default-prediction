# Project Overview
In this project, I have developed a LightGBM model trained to predict loan default risks based on various numerical and categorical features. To make this model accessible and user-friendly, I built a simple yet effective web application using Streamlit. This demo app allows users to input loan-related data and receive real-time predictions on whether a loan is likely to default.

# Key Components
Machine Learning Model: A LightGBM model, fine-tuned to accurately predict loan default risks based on normalized numerical and categorical data.
Interactive Web Application: Developed with Streamlit, this app provides an easy-to-use interface for data input and prediction.
Numerical Data Normalization: Ensures that input values are scaled appropriately to match the modelâ€™s training data.
Categorical Feature Handling: Allows users to select from various categorical options, with the app managing unused options correctly.
