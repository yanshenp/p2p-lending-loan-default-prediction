# p2p-lending-loan-default-prediction
  This project utilized the LightGBM algorithm alongside the Boruta feature selection technique to identify the most critical features and develop a predictive model for forecasting loan defaults in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending sector. The goal was to create a model that accurately predicts loan defaults, benefiting lenders and P2P lending platforms.
